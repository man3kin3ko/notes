Microsoft introduced Component Object Model (COM) in Windows 3.11 as a method to implement objects that could be used by different frameworks (ActiveX, COM+, DCOM etc.) and in different Windows environments allowing code reuse. 

COM технологии позволяют поддерживать управляемость кода, избегать древней, но все такой же актуальной проблемы известной под названием DLL HELL.

Abuse of COM objects enables red teams to execute arbitrary code on behalf of a trusted process. Administrator privileges are not required to perform COM Hijacking since classes in the HKCU registry hive are executed prior to the classes in HKLM.

Although not security vulnerabilities on their own, usage of COM objects can be used to defeat detection based on process behavior and heuristic signatures.

The term “COM Object” refers to an executable code section which implements one or more interfaces deriving from IUnknown. IUnknown is an interface with 3 methods, which support object lifetime reference counting and discovery of additional interfaces. Every COM object is identified by a unique binary identifier. These 128 bit (16 byte) globally unique identifiers are generically referred to as GUIDs.

The Windows Registry contains a set of keys which enable the system to map a CLSID to the underlying code implementation (in a DLL or EXE) and thus create the object.
